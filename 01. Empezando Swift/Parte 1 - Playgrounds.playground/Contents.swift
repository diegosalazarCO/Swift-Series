That's a pretty simple tip calculation. Let's start a new one: what's the total amount you should pay if you want to leave an 18% tip on $75? Add your calculation below.

You can use `print()` and the debug area, or just type numbers and see the results in the sidebar.

Now say you used a coupon to get $4 off your meal. You should deduct the $4 _after_ calculating the tip.

/*:
Finally, what if you were splitting the bill five ways? That's $75, 18% tip, $4 coupon, split five ways. How much should each person contribute?

Remember your order of operations: multiplication and division go before addition and subtraction. If you need to, you can use parentheses to give a higher priority like this: `(1 + 2) * 3` means to do the addition first, and then multiply.
