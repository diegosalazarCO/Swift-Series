#### Video 10: Enumerations Challenge

**Note:** If you're seeing this text as comments rather than nicely-rendered text, select Editor\Show Rendered Markup in the Xcode menu.

In this challenge, you'll add raw values to your `RestaurantRating` enumeration to consolidate all its details into a single type. Scroll down past to the next set of instructions to get started!

/*:
Here's the enumeration! You have two things to update here:

- Change the definition to `enum RestaurantRating: Double` to indicate the raw value type.
- Update each case with a value. This will look something like `case Awesome = 0.20' and you can look below at the `tipPercentages` dictionary for the values.

Scroll down to the next set of instructions when you're done!

  var restaurant: Restaurant
  var totalBill: Double
  var rating: RestaurantRating

/*:
Now that the tip percentages are stored right in the enumeration, you don't need this dictionary anymore. Remove it!
*/


/*:
Now how do you access the raw value? Once you have an enumeration instance such as `rating`, just use the `rawValue` property on it!

Update the method below to use the enumeration's raw value. This will also simplify the code since you don't have to worry about it being an optional.

    let tipPercentage = rating.rawValue

    return totalBill * tipPercentage
