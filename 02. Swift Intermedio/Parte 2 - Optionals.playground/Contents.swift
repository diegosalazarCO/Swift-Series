**Note:** If you're seeing this text as comments rather than nicely-rendered text, select Editor\Show Rendered Markup in the Xcode menu.

In this short challenge, you'll add one more optional and then have to make a choice on how to deal with it.

Update the rating property below to be an optional:

    var rating: RestaurantRating?

This should be a quick, but open-ended challenge. What would it mean if you instantiated a new restaurant bill with a `nil` rating? No tip? Or a standard tip? This depends on your own needs, of course.

Now that the rating is optional, you'll need to update `calculateTip()` to handle it. You have several options here, from if-let binding to nil coalescing. See what you come up with, and be sure to test your results at the bottom with a new `RestaurantBill` that has a nil rating.

    let bill2 = RestaurantBill(restaurant: restaurant, totalBill: 100, rating: nil)
